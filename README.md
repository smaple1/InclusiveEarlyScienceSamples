All samples are produced with Pythia Version 6.428. 

Metadata has all the log files, runcards has all the inputfiles, one associates with each simulation sample.

There are issues with the cross sections in the Q2 1000-10000 log files when ran for 50k events. Log files for a shorter run of 500 events are provided with the naming "lowStatForXsec" that contain more reasonable cross section estimates.
